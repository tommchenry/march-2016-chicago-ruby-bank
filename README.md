## ChicagoRuby Hack Night - Bank

Tonight we will be building a bank.

A Bank has individual accounts. An account is owned by a single person. People have first and last names. Each person can open an account. Each account is owned by a person and has a default value of zero. A person can add or withdraw funds from an account. An account saves a transaction record when its value has changed. An account has a transaction history.

At any given time I can see all of the people who have opened accounts with the bank.

A Bank has a collection of accounts. A person can have multiple accounts. The Bank should know the balance of all of its accounts.

At any given time I can see a record of all accounts held by the bank.

An account has transactions. A transaction record saves the date and time of each transaction. A transaction belongs to an account. A transaction belongs to a person. A transaction has an id.

At any given time I can see all of the transactions that have happened over time. I can search accounts by person, account or id.
